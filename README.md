# HDAI Drop rate calculator (aka How dry is [Moo](https://www.wiseoldman.net/players/moo%20shu%20pork))
>A drop rate calculator for Oldschool Runescape drops to see if I can complain about not having the baby mole pet yet (or any Runescape item)

## Why

[This pet right here.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Baby_mole) 

In Runescape, one can obtain certain pets for doing certain content, like training some skills, or killing bosses. These pets do nothing but follow you around, but some of them are cute, like Baby Mole. The Baby Mole pet is a pet that you get from killing the [Giant Mole](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Giant_Mole) boss in OSRS, and this pet is all that I've ever wanted on Oldschool Runescape. Of course, I've gone over double the drop rate for the pet, which is usually ~60 hours to obtain the pet at peak efficiency. This web app will be a manifestation of my pain through code.
